**Part 3** 
    *Chapter 1*
        numbers.py
            The program prints out all integer numbers greater than zero but smaller than the input.
        powers_OF_N.py
            Modify powers_OF_Two so that the user can also enter the multiplied base (in powers_OF_Two the base is always 2).
        powers_OF_Two
            I wrote a program that asks the user for an upper limit and prints the powers of 2 starting from 1 and doubling each time. The program stops before or when it reaches the limit.
        print_Numbers
            I  wrote a program that prints all even numbers from 2 to 30 using a loop. Each number will be printed on a separate line.
        The_Sum_OF_Consecutive_Numbers
            I wrote a program that asked the user to type in a limit, calculated the sum of consecutive numbers (1 + 2 + 3 + ...) until the sum was at least equal to the limit, and printed both the result and the calculation performed.
    *Chapter 2*
        A_Framed_Word
            I wrote a program that asks the user for a string and prints it out inside a frame of * characters. The width of the frame is 30 characters.
        A_Line_OF_Hashes
            I wrote a program that asks the user for a width and then prints out a line of hash (#) characters with the specified width.
        A_Rectangle_OF_Hashes
            I modified the A_Line_OF_Hashes program to ask for both the width and height. It will then print a rectangle of hash (#) characters with the specified dimensions. 
        Does_It_Contain_Vowels
            I wrote a program that asks the user to input a string and then checks if the string contains any of the vowels a, e, or o. Depending on whether any of these vowels are found, it prints out different messages.
        End_TO_Beginning
            I wrote a program that asked the user for a string and then printed out the string in reversed order, with each character on a separate line.
        Find_All_The_Substrings
            I wrote a program that asks for a string and a character. It then prints all substrings that are at least three characters long and start with the specified character.
        Right_Aligned
            I wrote a program that asks the user for a string and then prints it out so that exactly 20 characters are displayed. If the input is shorter than 20 characters, the beginning of the string is filled with * characters.
        Second_AND_Second_TO_Last_Characters
            I wrote a program that asked the user for a string and then printed out a message based on whether the second character and the second-to-last character are the same or not.
        String_Multiplied
            I wrote a program that asked the user for a string and an amount, then printed the string as many times as specified by the amount, all on one line without any extra spaces or symbols.
        Substrings_Part_1
            I wrote a program that asks the user to type a string and then prints all substrings starting from the first character to the last character.
        Substrings_Part_2
            I wrote a program that asks for a string and then prints all substrings from the last character to the first character.
        The_Longer_String
            I wrote a program that asked the user for two strings of characters and printed the longer one. If the strings were of equal length, the program printed “Strings of equal length”.
        The_Second_Occurrence
            I wrote a program that finds the second occurrence of a substring in a given string. If there is no second occurrence, it prints a message indicating so. The program ensures that the occurrences don't overlap.
        Underlining
            I wrote a program that repeatedly asks the user for strings using a loop, printing each string with an underline. The program stops when the user enters an empty string.
    *Chapter 3*
        Factorial
            I wrote a program that asks the user for an integer. If the number is 0 or negative, the program terminates. Otherwise, it prints the factorial of the number (the product of all positive integers up to that number). For example, 5! = 1 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 4 × 4 × 5 = 120.
        First_Letters_OF_Words
            The program then prints out the first letter of each word in the sentence, each letter on a separate line.
        Flip_THE_Pairs
             The program prints out all the positive integer values from 1 up to the number. However, the order of the numbers is changed so that each pair or numbers is flipped. That is, 2 comes before 1, 4 before 3 and so forth.
        Multiplication 
            The program prints out a list of multiplication operations until both operands reach the number given by the user.
        Taking_Turns
            The program prints out the positive integers between 1 and the number itself, alternating between the two ends of the range
